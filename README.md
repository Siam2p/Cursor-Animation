# Cursor-Animation
Cursor Animation is a simple web project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to replace the default mouse cursor with a glowing, animated one. It follows the mouse, disappears after 3 seconds of inactivity, and reappears when the user moves the mouse again. It's responsive and fully customizable.
