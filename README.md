# Cursor Animation

This project demonstrates a simple yet visually appealing cursor animation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The animation replaces the default cursor with a custom glowing effect that follows the user's mouse movements. Additionally, the cursor disappears after a few seconds of inactivity.

## Features
- Custom cursor with a glowing animation effect
- Cursor follows the mouse movement smoothly
- Cursor disappears after 3 seconds of inactivity
- Cursor reappears when the user moves the mouse
- Responsive and minimal design

## File Structure

### 1. `index.html`
This file sets up the structure of the webpage. It includes:
- A `div` with the class `cursor` to represent the custom cursor
- A `section` with the class `main` containing a heading
- Links to the external CSS and JavaScript files

### 2. `index.css`
This file defines the styles for the cursor animation and the webpage. It includes:
- Global styles for a full-screen layout with a dark background
- Custom styles for the cursor, including size, color, and glow effect
- Keyframe animations for a color transition effect
- A larger, semi-transparent cursor trail effect

### 3. `index.js`
This JavaScript file controls the behavior of the custom cursor. It includes:
- Event listeners to track mouse movement and update the cursor's position
- A timeout function that hides the cursor after 3 seconds of inactivity
- An event listener to hide the cursor when the mouse leaves the screen

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Move the mouse around to see the custom cursor follow your pointer.
3. Stop moving the mouse, and the cursor will disappear after 3 seconds.
4. Move the mouse again, and the cursor will reappear.

## Customization
- Modify the CSS properties in `index.css` to change the cursor's size, color, or animation speed.
- Adjust the timeout duration in `index.js` to change how long it takes for the cursor to disappear.
- Experiment with different animation effects to enhance the user experience.

## Browser Compatibility
This project works on modern web browsers that support CSS animations and JavaScript event listeners. Some older browsers may not fully support the cursor effect.

## Conclusion
This project provides a simple yet engaging way to customize the cursor experience on a webpage. It is ideal for creative websites, interactive web applications, or as a learning exercise for front-end development.
